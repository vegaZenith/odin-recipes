<h1>Chicken Parmesan</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a favourite of mine, a breaded chicken cutlet served with delicious pasta! 
    I prefer to slice my chicken breasts thin, bake them, and finish them off under the broiler. 
    You could have any sauce you like with your pasta, I love an alfredo.
    This ends up being a pretty quick, tasty meal. Great for week nights or the weekend.

<h2>Steps</h2>

    <li>In a second bowl, place the bread crumbs and thinly shredded parmesan, enough to coat the chicken</li>
    <li>Place each chicken cutlet in the egg and then coat the cutlet with the bread crumb and cheese mixture</li>
    <li>Place the chicken cutlets on a baking sheet and put in the oven for 15 minutes</li>
    <li>After the chicken is cooked, spoon a small amount of tomato sauce on top of each cutlet</li>
    <li>Sprinkle each cutlet with shredded parmesan and mozzerlla</li>
    <li>Set the oven to broil and put the chicken under the broiler until the cheese starts to brown, and remove</li>
